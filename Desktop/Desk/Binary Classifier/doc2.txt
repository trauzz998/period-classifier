In this paper, we develop a temporal representation framework for communication and social context to efficiently predict communication flow in social networks. The problem is important because it facilitates determining social and market trends as well as efficient information paths among people. We describe communication flow by two parameters: the intent to communicate and communication delay. There are three key contributions in this paper. To estimate the intent and delay, we design features to characterize communication and social context. Communication context refers to the attributes of current communication. Social context refers to the patterns of participation in communication (information roles) and the degree of overlap of friends between two people (strength of ties).
