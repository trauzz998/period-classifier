Information role is a contextual attribute acquired over time which impacts a personâ€™s communication behavior. We formally define three different categories of roles of people: (a) G.E.N. generators, people who generate information by themselves or from other sources (e.g. external events like the American Idol or iPhone release), (b) M.E.D. mediators, people who act as transmitters of information between people, and (c) R.E.P. receptors, people who mostly receive messages. Drawing an analogy with the hyper-linking structure of the web, we notice that the generators and the receptors act like authorities and hubs respectively in the social network.
